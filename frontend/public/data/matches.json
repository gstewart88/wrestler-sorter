        "background": "Kenny Omega earned the title shot by winning the 2016 G1 Climax, becoming the first non-Japanese winner of that tournament's modern era and securing the right to challenge for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Kazuchika Okada entered Wrestle Kingdom 11 as the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion, established as NJPW's top star after a dominant run that included multiple high-profile title defenses.\nThe rivalry was fueled by factional tensions, Omega as a leading figure in Bullet Club and Okada as the centerpiece of CHAOS, which produced repeated confrontations in multi-man matches, tag bouts, and promotional segments throughout late 2016. Those encounters sharpened the personal stakes: Omega's aggressive, boundary-pushing style and Okada's composed, championship-level psychology created a clear contrast that promoters and fans framed as a generational and stylistic clash.\nPromos and in-ring moments in the months before January amplified anticipation. Omega's G1 victory gave him momentum and legitimacy; Okada's long title reign and status as NJPW's “ace” made the match a test of whether a new international star could unseat the company's established leader.",
        "spoiler": "Okada retained the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom 11, but the match's immediate aftermath was to intensify and extend the Okada-Omega rivalry, elevate Kenny Omega's international profile, and set up a string of high-stakes rematches that became one of modern NJPW's defining series.\nThe match was widely praised by fans and critics for its pacing, dramatic near-falls, and sustained intensity, and it immediately boosted Kenny Omega's standing as a legitimate main-event star while reinforcing Kazuchika Okada's status as NJPW's top champion. The Tokyo Dome main event drew attention beyond Japan, helping NJPW reach a broader international audience and increasing demand for further encounters between the two men.\nPromoters capitalized on the rivalry: ticket demand and international interest increased for shows featuring either man, and the series helped NJPW expand its global footprint through streaming and media coverage. For Omega, the sustained spotlight contributed to his eventual status as a global star beyond NJPW; for Okada, the matches reinforced his role as the company's “ace” and a performer capable of carrying multi-match sagas.\nThe WK11 bout did not settle the rivalry; instead it served as the opening chapter of a multi-match saga that culminated in further classics and a title change later in the series, cementing both wrestlers' reputations and influencing booking approaches to long-term rivalries in modern pro wrestling.",

        "background": "The match at WrestleMania 13 grew from Steve Austin's rapid rise in 1996 and Bret Hart's position as a veteran standard-bearer for the company. Throughout late 1996 and early 1997 Austin's increasingly aggressive, anti-authority persona and hard-hitting style made him a breakout star, while Hart remained one of the promotion's most respected in-ring technicians and storytellers. Promos, brawls, and encounters on television and at house shows escalated the personal stakes between the two: Austin's relentless, no-nonsense approach clashed with Hart's cerebral, submission-based psychology. The match was framed as a decisive, violent confrontation between a new, volatile star and an established master of the ring.\n\nWrestleMania 13’s stipulation — a No Disqualification Submission match — amplified the brutality and allowed both men to push physical limits. The build emphasized toughness, pride, and the idea that only one man could impose his will. In the weeks leading to the event, Austin’s willingness to brawl and take punishment contrasted with Hart’s methodical ring craft, creating a narrative that the match would be both a physical brawl and a psychological chess match. That tension set the stage for a contest remembered for its intensity, blood, and dramatic finish.",
        "spoiler": "The match is widely remembered for the double turn: Hart’s technical, principled persona hardened into a heel, while Austin’s bloodied, defiant performance converted crowd sympathy into sustained babyface momentum. Bret Hart leaned into a more bitter, cerebral heel presentation that influenced his promos and booking; Steve Austin’s image as a rebellious, anti‑authority figure became the centerpiece of WWF storytelling and merchandising going forward. The bout’s storytelling techniques, selling, and crowd psychology became a template for future marquee matches. Wrestling shifted toward character‑driven, reality‑tinged narratives, and Austin’s mainstream appeal helped WWF capitalize on that shift commercially and culturally.",

NJPW’s international profile rose as the match drew attention outside Japan, prompting greater focus on global streaming, English commentary, and cross‑border talent narratives.\n\nOmega’s ascent validated the idea that non‑Japanese stars could carry NJPW’s top title and helped normalize international main‑event pushes. \n\n Dominion 2018 didn’t just crown a new champion — it validated a model of long‑form, character‑driven main events that reshaped booking priorities and accelerated NJPW’s global ambitions, with ripple effects felt across the wrestling business.",

        "spoiler": "The bout at Sakura Genesis 2017 left an immediate, stark legacy: Shibata collapsed after a shoot‑style headbutt, later diagnosed with a subdural hematoma, a life‑threatening brain bleed that required urgent medical attention and long recovery. The injury transformed the match from a celebrated strong‑style encounter into a cautionary touchstone about in‑ring risk and the use of unprotected skull‑on‑skull strikes.\n\nMany reviewers hailed the match as one of the most brutal, emotionally raw main events of the 2010s, praising both men’s commitment and the match’s dramatic arc. Commentators and fans debated whether the dangerous spot was necessary, with some calling it an avoidable risk that overshadowed the performance.\n\nIn the years after, the match has been revisited as both a career‑defining performance and a sobering example of wrestling’s physical limits; retrospectives emphasize its artistry while acknowledging the human cost and the industry’s responsibility to protect performers. Shibata’s in‑ring future was uncertain for a long time, and the bout remains a frequent reference point in conversations about safety, booking, and the ethics of “strong style” presentation.",

Omega entered as the international, boundary‑pushing challenger whose 2016–17 run had elevated him into true main‑event status, while Okada remained the company’s long‑reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion and narrative center, making the bout a classic established‑champion vs. ascendant‑outsider confrontation\n\nPromos and prior matches emphasized contrasting styles, Okada’s championship psychology and Rainmaker theatrics against Omega’s inventive offense and willingness to push rules and pacing, which created a sense that Dominion could either settle the rivalry or extend it depending on finish and crowd reaction. The match was promoted and discussed as a potential all‑time classic, with many fans expecting a long, dramatic encounter rather than a short flurry; that framing shaped both in‑ring pacing and audience expectations.",

CM Punk’s character had been cultivated as an outsider and anti‑establishment voice within WWE; his real‑life frustrations and backstage standing were woven into television storytelling. Punk’s momentum accelerated after a series of high‑profile promos and matches that positioned him as a credible top‑card threat to Cena’s mainstream, company‑approved persona. The Money in the Bank build leaned on Punk’s Chicago roots and the idea that a hometown victory could be both a storyline payoff and a genuine career turning point.\n\nPunk’s promos in the months before Money in the Bank, especially the infamous “pipebomb” on Monday Night Raw, used unscripted‑sounding language, direct criticism of WWE management, and references to real backstage dynamics. That promo and subsequent interviews blurred the line between storyline and reality, convincing many viewers that Punk’s grievances were authentic rather than purely scripted. The result was a surge in audience engagement often called the “Summer of Punk,” where chants, social media, and mainstream coverage amplified the angle’s impact. Promos referenced contract dates, creative control, and perceived favoritism in ways that sounded like insider talk; WWE leaned into this ambiguity, allowing fans to debate what was real.
